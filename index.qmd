-   Thank you all for joining us today!

-   Nalanda Foundation Day on 27^th^ September

-   Celebrating it today with our community

-   Started the Academy in 2013

-   But its story started some 23-24 years back

## Problems

-   First hand experience of problems in an Engineering College in UP (1995-98) - blatant caste discrimination, language bias, no support system for our students
-   The concept of "merit" as opposed to policy of reservations

## Insight Magazine - A student magazine (2004-08)

-   Started in 2004, in JNU

-   First of its kind in India. By students themselves

-   Became a platform for students from more than 80 universities

-   Focus on publishing our student's success stories and their views

## Insight Foundation (2007-13)

-   Magazine helped us to build a network across the country

-   Also exposed us to the rampant discrimination and other problems

-   Felt the need to document and create a student support system

-   Formed Insight Foundation in 2007 with a few friends:

    -   National Students Telephone Helpline

    -   Dalits and Adivasi Students Portal

    -   Documentation/reports on students' issues

## Insight Foundation (2007-13)

- Resulted in some discussion on discrimination in Indian campuses

- Despite government assurance, no justice

- Very depressing

- Closed Insight Foundation

- Recognised the need to prepare our students at grassroots

## Wardha - 2013

- I was always fascinated by Maharashtra and Buddhism

- In 2013 August got an opportunity to visit Wardha

- Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar College of Social work via Dr. Chetana Sawai

- Trained 22 women students for 4 months for TISS entrance

- 5 selections in TISS campuses

- Got new perspective on supporting our students.
